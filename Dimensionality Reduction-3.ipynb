    "For a square matrix A to be diagonalizable using the Eigen-Decomposition approach, it must meet the following conditions:\n",

    ">Diagonalizability: The matrix A must be similar to a diagonal matrix D. This means there must exist an invertible matrix P such that A = P * D * P^(-1), where D is a diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues of A, and P contains the corresponding eigenvectors.\n",

    "Brief Proof:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume that A is an n x n matrix with n linearly independent eigenvectors v1, v2, ..., vn corresponding to the eigenvalues λ1, λ2, ..., λn, respectively. We want to show that A can be diagonalized as A = P * D * P^(-1), where D is a diagonal matrix containing the eigenvalues and P contains the eigenvectors.\n",
